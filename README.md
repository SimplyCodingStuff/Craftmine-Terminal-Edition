# Craftmine: Terminal Edition
This is my first project and is the first version of my terminal-based text game where you try and survive 100 days.  
It's writen in Python for simplicity(and because I'm trying to learn Python) and it's currently in version 1.0.0.  

## Actions
help - brings up the help menu with all the actions  
explore - you explore for the day  
craft - you need to craft something  
give up - you decide to lose  
advanced resources - lists all the advance resources and how much of them you have  
difficulty - allows you to change the difficulty  
objective - displays how to beat the game  
portal - asks you if you want to enter the portal if you have discovered a portal  
nothing - you do nothing but rest, there's also a 1/3 chance you heal some  

## Locations and Events + chances
Found scraps: 1/3  
Village: 1/12  
Tree: 1/6  
Rock: 1/8  
Cave: 1/12  
Getting attacked in a cave: 1/6  
Nothing: everything else  

## How to run
To run the game first set the default app to the command prompt. Then double click the file to start the game. Also, make sure you have the latest version of Python.
