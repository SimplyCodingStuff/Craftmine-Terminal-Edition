# Craftmine: Terminal Edition
This is my first project and is the first version of my terminal-based text game where you try and survive 100 days.  
It's writen in python for simplicity, it's currently in version 1.0.0.

give up - you decide to lose  
advanced resources - lists all the advance resources and how much of them you have  
difficulty - allows you to change the difficulty  
objective - displays how to beat the game  
portal - asks you if you want to enter the portal if you have discovered a portal  
nothing - you do nothing but rest, there's also a 1/3 chance you heal some
